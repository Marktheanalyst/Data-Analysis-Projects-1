### Data Cleaning/Preparation
---
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
EDA involved exploring sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the monthly distribution of revenue?
- What is the revenue generated by body style and car color?
- What is the reveneue by region?

### Data Analysis
---
Here are some SQL queries used in this project:
```
  SELECT *
FROM CARSALES

SELECT SUM (PRICE)
FROM CARSALES

SELECT AVG(PRICE) AS AVERAGE_PRICE
FROM CARSALES

SELECT AVG(round Annual_Income, 0) AS AVERAGE_Income
FROM CARSALES

SELECT SUM (Annual_Income)
FROM CARSALES
```
### Results
---
These insights can help the company understand customer preferences and regional performance and may guide future strategies, such as inventory management and targeted marketing.
### Conclusion
---
The dashboard indicates that the company is performing well, especially with SUV and black car sales, and sees seasonal boosts. Thereâ€™s an opportunity to optimize inventory, target high-performing regions, and capitalize on the demand for mid-range to high-end vehicles. Tailored marketing strategies during peak months, along with a focus on popular models and colors, could drive even greater sales.
